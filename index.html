      <h2>The webpage serves as reflections of 3 major projects about Data for ENGL 3844 class </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>The projects of the Writing and Digital Media class cover how we perceive the use of data. The data in here is flexible as even usage of the social media and our correlated behaviors are counted as data. The class completed three major projects, data collection (collection of our daily habits with data), data viz (visualization of the data collection) and explained video (explains a broader social issue with data). </strong>

          <h3>Data Collection: Soonyoung's Mood Tracking on usage of YouTube</h3>

          <h3>Data Visualization: Visualization on the Data collection:Soonyoung's Mood Tracking on usage of YouTube </h3>
          <p>
            <strong>This project is visualization based on using the results of the data collection project. The entire graph is stacked bar chart and the project has several visual attributes. The following list is to help you understand the project.</strong>
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The title (Soonyoung's YouTube MoodTrack) with two different faces(emotions) of mine give you ideas what it's about the project.
              </li>
              <li>
                Different use of color with its gradiation from 1 to 5 is different mood and its intensity.
              </li>
              <li>
                The first row of the chart indicates it is the genre of videos that I watched.
              </li>
              <li>
                I drew the chart in order of frequency of listening to the genre. So, I only listened to classical music 3 times total while I watched coding lecture 13 times during a week of period.
              </li>
              <li>
                The color of bargraph in vertical way represents from passive mood (sleepy,relaxed,sad) to more active mood (pleasant, focused, intense).
              </li>
              <li>
                 However, there are some neutral emotions such as satisfaction/unsatisfaction that I put between passive mood and active mood.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <strong>The conclusion that I made from this projet, the classical music, workout videos, self improvement lectures, and coding lectures tend to result positive mood while Korean music, beauty-tip videos or random videos on YouTube tend to result more various emotions with some negative mood like sad and unpleasant feelings. </strong>

          <h3>The group project of Explained Video was developed by Anthony Farina, Soonyoung Kim, and Heather Trobridge. </h3>
          <p>
            <strong>The topic of the video is about Content Moderation, and the video on the left is the final project. The video is separated by three scenes in order of explanation made by Anthony, Soonyoung, and Heather.</strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The scene 1 covers the definition and social media's content moderation platforms.
            </li>
            <li>
              The scene 2 covers the positive and negative outcomes of content moderation, and Human content moderation worker's responsibilities and difficulties.
            </li>
            <li>
              The scene 3 covers the positive and negative aspects of Algorithm content moderation, and the ethics of content moderation.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            <strong>The associated research of the project led me to ponder how I've used the social media data without fear of content moderation. Thinking of some people or even machine based program will always watch me how I use digital data make me feel quite insecure freely enjoying social media. </strong>
